Steps to create server in Node.js:
----------------------------------

1. Store 'http' module in a valiable called 'http' by using require function
2. Define a port
3. Create a server user 'createServer' function.
4. Make server to listen to the pre-defined port.

Routing:
-------

1. Not all client requests are the same.
2. We should creating a API that responds differently depending on the requested url path.

Express.js:
----------

1. Web server for Node.js

HTTP methods:
-------------

GET - Read
POST - Create
PUT - Update

1. mongo atlasDB
2. mongoose - npm (tool used to connect Node.js and MongoDB: MongoDB Object modeling tool)
3. node + mongoDB connectivity
4. POST, PUT, DELETE
5. dotenv - Loads environment variables from .env file.

For eg: You are running a shop. Shop has products. 

Each produc has name, id, price, discount_price


mongodb+srv://test:test@cluster0.xtxkf8s.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority


mongoose - Object modelling:

1. Derive a custom schema - It represents the structure of a particular document.(model)
2. Compile schema to model (To access and manipulate documents)(model)
3. Initialize a document(router)

Module in Node.js:

A set of functions you want to include in your application.
JS library
It provides a way to re-use code in your application.
