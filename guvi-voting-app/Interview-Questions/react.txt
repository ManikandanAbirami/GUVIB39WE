ReactJS:

--> React is JavaScript library for building user-interfaces

--> React was introduced by Facebook in 2011

--> React helps us to build interactive user-interfces called web applications

--> Uses a Virtual DOM

--> Virtual DOM means, a tree of JavaScript objects that represent the "actual DOM".

--> use efficient diffing algorithm - React follows the concept of Virtual DOM, which makes DOM
                                      manipulation superfast and easy.

--> ECMAScript(ES6) - latest features of JavaScript.

--> Babel helps in converting the ES6 code into ES5

--> A Single-Page Application (SPA) works on the browser and does not require a page to be reloaded
    completely.

--> A Multi-Page Applications (MPA) - browser reloads the contents of the page completely and
    downloads all the resources again.

Components:

Components are just JavaScript way of writing independent, reusable, and dynamic code.

Types of components: Class Components & Functional Components

//State, Props, hooks

--> JSX - It is HTML-looking syntax, actually it is XML extension to ECMAScript specification.
(HTML + JS + XML)

--> Instead of using pure JS for building DOM elements, you can use JSX to build DOM elements which
    gives flexibility to developers to use familiar syntax(HTML)

Difference between HTML and JSX:

--> JSX properties are not similar to HTML attribues
--> Case sensitive
--> Closing tag required
--> JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag


--> React.createElement
--> ReactDOM.render(arg1, arg2); arg1 - WHAT to render, arg2 - WHERE to render -
    Is used to write the component to the DOM.

props:

A JS object passed as a parameter to functional components.

state:

--> State is something that is controlled within a component, unlike props, which are controlled
    by a parent component.
--> State can be maintained inside a class component only.
--> State is always initialised inside the class constructor
--> setState() method is used to set the state.
--> Also, a change in state call the render() method again.
